Title: Smart Study Companion – AI-Powered Focus & Wellness Assistant

Goal: Build a Python-based web app that helps students maintain focus during study sessions by analyzing webcam + microphone input and providing gentle nudges.

Core Features:

Webcam Monitoring (with user consent only):

Detect drowsiness (eye closure, yawning) using OpenCV + a lightweight facial landmarks model.

Detect stress via facial tension (furrowed brows, clenched jaw).

Detect distraction by monitoring gaze direction (head turned away from screen).

Mic Monitoring (optional):

Capture short bursts of audio → analyze for signs of stress (sighing, heavy breathing).

Keep processing local only (no cloud sending).

Focus Nudges:

If drowsy → “😴 Looks like you need a 5-min break.”

If distracted → “👀 Eyes back on the prize!”

If focused → “✅ Great job, keep going!”

Dashboard UI (web app):

Show live webcam preview with overlays (eye/mouth detection boxes).

A status panel: FOCUSED | DROWSY | DISTRACTED | STRESSED.

A timeline graph of focus vs. distraction over the session.

Privacy & Safety:

All analysis runs locally in browser or backend, no data storage.

Add a consent modal before enabling webcam/mic.

Include a SAFETY.md explaining how privacy is preserved.

Project Setup:

Backend: FastAPI (Python) for ML inference.

Frontend: React (or simple HTML/JS) for dashboard.

ML: OpenCV, Dlib/MediaPipe for face landmarks, TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch for stress detection.

Visualization: Chart.js or Recharts for timeline graph.

Logging: Save only session stats (no raw video/audio).

Deliverables:

main.py → FastAPI backend (video/audio analysis endpoints).

frontend/ → React or HTML dashboard with live video preview + results.

models/ → Pretrained lightweight facial landmarks & stress detection models.

static/ → CSS, JS.

README.md → Project intro, setup guide, ethical disclaimer.

SAFETY.md → Privacy guarantees (no data collection/storage).

requirements.txt → Dependencies list.

LICENSE (MIT recommended).
